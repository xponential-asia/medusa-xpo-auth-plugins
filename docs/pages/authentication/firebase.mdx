### Configuration

In order to be able to use the **firebase** authentication provider, you have to add the configuration to your
newly added plugins. To do so here are the steps

<CircleStep index={1}>
    Configure your **firebase** account
</CircleStep>

<CircleStep index={2}>
    Go to your `medusa-config.js`
</CircleStep>

<CircleStep index={3}>
    Check that the variables are set with the appropriate values

    ```js
    const BACKEND_URL = process.env.BACKEND_URL || "localhost:9000"
    const ADMIN_URL = process.env.ADMIN_URL || "localhost:7000"
    const STORE_URL = process.env.STORE_URL || "localhost:8000"

    const CredentialJsonPath = process.env.FIREBASE_CREDS_JSON_PATH || ""
    ```

    Then in your `plugins` collections, if you did not already inserted the plugin, add the following otherwise, you can
    just add the `firebase` options to your auth plugin options
    ```js
  {
    resolve: "medusa-xpo-auth-plugin",
    /** @type {import('medusa-xpo-auth-plugin').AuthOptions} */
    options: [
      {
        type: "firebase",
        // strict: "all", // or "none" or "store" or "admin"
        strict: "none",
        identifier: "firebase",
        credentialJsonPath: CredentialJsonPath,
        admin: {
          // authPath: '/admin/auth/firebase',
          // expiresIn: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,
          // verifyCallback: (container, decodedToken, strict) => {
          //    // implement your custom verify callback here if you need it
          // }
        },
        store: {
          // authPath: '/store/auth/firebase',
          // expiresIn: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,
          // verifyCallback: (container, decodedToken, strict) => {
          //    // implement your custom verify callback here if you need it
          // }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
    ```
    The options that are commented are `optional` and the value that you see are the default values
</CircleStep>

<CircleStep index={4}>
    Update your client to add the authentication action
    ```ts
    const firebaseLogin = async (token: string) => {
        await fetch(`${medusa_url}/${authPath}`, {
            method: 'GET',
            headers: {
                Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`
            },
            credentials: 'include'
        })
    }
    ```
    This endpoint will return a session cookie that you can use to authenticate with the store API.
    It is important to include the `credentials: 'include'` option in the fetch call to ensure that the cookie is set.
    If you are using Axios to make the request, the equivalent option is `withCredentials: true`.
</CircleStep>

### Default behaviour

The default `verifyCallback` flow looks as follow (unless the `strict` option is changed to `none` or `store` or `admin` depending on the targeted domain)
- for the `admin`
    - if the user trying to authenticate exists
        - then we are looking in the metadata to find if the strategy identifier is present in `authProvider`.
          - If it is not, the user authentication gets rejected.
          - In the case it is present, then the user authentication gets authorized.
   - if the user trying to authenticate does not exist, an unauthorized error will be returned
- for the `store`
    - if the customer trying to authenticate exists
        - then we are looking in the metadata to find if the strategy identifier is present in `authProvider`.
          - If none are found, then the customer gets authenticated and can proceed and the metadata gets updated.
          - In the case another external authentication method have been used in the past, then an unauthorized
          will be returned.
   - if the customer trying to authenticate does not exist, a new customer will be created with a randomly generated password and the authentication
     flow follow the previous point
