### Configuration

In order to be able to use the **auth0** authentication provider, you have to add the configuration to your
newly added plugins. To do so here are the steps

<CircleStep index={1}>
    Configure your **auth0 developer console**
</CircleStep>

<CircleStep index={2}>
    Go to your `medusa-config.js`
</CircleStep>

<CircleStep index={3}>
    Check that the variables are set with the appropriate values

    ```js
    const BACKEND_URL = process.env.BACKEND_URL || "localhost:9000"
    const ADMIN_URL = process.env.ADMIN_URL || "localhost:7000"
    const STORE_URL = process.env.STORE_URL || "localhost:8000"

    const Auth0ClientId = process.env.AUTH0_CLIENT_ID || ""
    const Auth0ClientSecret = process.env.AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET || ""
    const Auth0Domain = process.env.AUTH0_DOMAIN || ""
    ```

    Then in your `plugins` collections, if you did not already inserted the plugin, add the following otherwise, you can
    just add the `auth0` options to your auth plugin options
    ```js
  {
    resolve: "medusa-xpo-auth-plugin",
    /** @type {import('medusa-xpo-auth-plugin').AuthOptions} */
    options: [
      {
        type: "auth0",
        // strict: "all", // or "none" or "store" or "admin"
        strict: "none",
        identifier: "auth0",
        clientID: Auth0ClientId,
        clientSecret: Auth0ClientSecret,
        auth0Domain: Auth0Domain,
        admin: {
          callbackUrl: `${BACKEND_URL}/admin/auth/auth0/cb`,
          failureRedirect: `${ADMIN_URL}/login`,
          // The success redirect can be overridden from the client by adding a query param `?redirectTo=your_url` to the auth url
          // This query param will have the priority over this configuration
          successRedirect: `${ADMIN_URL}/`
        },
        store: {
          callbackUrl: `${BACKEND_URL}/store/auth/auth0/cb`,
          failureRedirect: `${STORE_URL}/login`,
          // The success redirect can be overridden from the client by adding a query param `?redirectTo=your_url` to the auth url
          // This query param will have the priority over this configuration
          successRedirect: `${STORE_URL}/`
        }
      }
    ]
  }
    ```
    The options that are commented are `optional` and the value that you see are the default values
</CircleStep>

<CircleStep index={4}>
    Update your client to add the authentication action

    After authentication is successfull, the user will be redirected to the `successRedirect` url with a `?access_token=your_token` query param and a session cookie will be set. Session will automatically be authenticated. The access token is a JWT that can be used with Authorization: Bearer `<token>` header to authenticate requests to the backend instead of using a session cookie.
</CircleStep>

### Default behaviour

The default `verifyCallback` flow looks as follow (unless the `strict` option is changed to `none` or `store` or `admin` depending on the targeted domain)
- for the `admin`
    - if the user trying to authenticate exists
        - then we are looking in the metadata to find if the strategy identifier is present in `authProvider`.
          - If it is not, the user authentication gets rejected.
          - In the case it is present, then the user authentication gets authorized.
   - if the user trying to authenticate does not exist, an unauthorized error will be returned
- for the `store`
    - if the customer trying to authenticate exists
        - then we are looking in the metadata to find if the strategy identifier is present in `authProvider`.
          - If none are found, then the customer gets authenticated and can proceed and the metadata gets updated.
          - In the case another external authentication method have been used in the past, then an unauthorized
          will be returned.
   - if the customer trying to authenticate does not exist, a new customer will be created with a randomly generated password and the authentication
     flow follow the previous point

### Request only access token in a JSON response

If you are using your Medusa application with a SPA or mobile frontend, you can request opt to receive the access token in a JSON response instead of a redirect.

To do this, you have to add ?returnAccessToken=true query parameter to your authentication call. Your authentication URL will then look like this: `${medusa_url}/${authPath}?returnAccessToken=true`

The response will look like this:
```json
{
    access_token: "<your-jwt-token>"
}
```
